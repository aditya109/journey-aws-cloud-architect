# List of Ports to be familiar with

Here's a list of **standard** ports you should see at least once. You shouldn't remember them (the exam will not test you on that), but **you should be able to differentiate between an Important (HTTPS - port 443) and a database port (PostgreSQL - port 5432)** 

**Important ports:**

- FTP: 21
- SSH: 22
- SFTP: 22 (same as SSH)
- HTTP: 80
- HTTPS: 443

**vs RDS Databases ports:**

- PostgreSQL: 5432
- MySQL: 3306
- Oracle RDS: 1521
- MSSQL Server: 1433
- MariaDB: 3306 (same as MySQL)
- Aurora: 5432 (if PostgreSQL compatible) or 3306 (if MySQL compatible)



> Don't stress out on remember those, just read that list once today and once before going into the exam and you should be all set :)

> Remember, you should just be able to differentiate an "Important Port" vs an "RDS database Port".
