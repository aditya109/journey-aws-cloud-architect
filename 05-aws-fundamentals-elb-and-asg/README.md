# High Availability and Scalability: ELB & ASG

## High Availability, Scalability and Load Balancing

Scalability means than an application/system can handle greater loads by adapting.
There are two kinds of scalability:

1. Vertical scalability;

2. Horizontal scalability (=elasticity).

>  *Scalability is linked but linked to high availability.*

High availability means running your application/system in at least 2 data centers (AZ).
The high availability can be:

1. Passive (for RDS Multi AZ for example);

2. Active (for horizontal scaling).

> The goal of high availability is to survive a data center loss. 

Load balancers are servers that forward traffice to multiple servers downstream.

*Why use a load balancer?*

- Spread load across multiple downstream instances.

- Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application.

- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances.

- Do regular health checks to your instances.

- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites.

- Enforce stickiness with cookies.

- High availablility across zones.

- Separate public traffic from private traffic.

## ELB Overview

An Elastic Load Balancer is 

- a <span style="color:orange">managed load balancer</span>,
  
  - AWS guarantees that it will be working
  
  - AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
  
  - AWS provides only a few configuration knobs

- cheap to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end

- integrated with many AWS offerings/services
  
  - EC2, EC2 Auto scaling groups, ECS
  
  - AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch
  
  - Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator

### Health Checks

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aditya109/journey-aws-cloud-architect/main/05-aws-fundamentals-elb-and-asg/assets/health-check.svg)

- Health checks are crucial for Load Balancers

- They enable the lb to know if the instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests.

- The health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common)

- If the reponse is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy

#### Types of LBs

AWS has 4 kinds of managed Load Balancers:

| LB type              | Year of Launch | Supported Protocol                                | Remarks             |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Classic LB - CLB     | 2009           | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL (secure TCP)                | v1 - old generation |
| Application LB - ALB | 2016           | HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket                            | v2 - new generation |
| Network LB - NLB     | 2017           | TCP, TLS (secure TCP), UDP                        | v2 - new generation |
| Gateway LB - GWLB    | 2020           | Operates at layer 3 (Network layer) - IP Protocol | latest              |

> It is recommended to use the newer generation lbs as they provide more features.
> 
> Some lbs can be setup as internal (private) or external (public) ELBs.

#### LB Security Groups

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aditya109/journey-aws-cloud-architect/main/05-aws-fundamentals-elb-and-asg/assets/lb-security-group.svg)

|                                               | LB Security Group                             | Application Security Group (allow traffic only from lb) |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| *type-protocol-port range-source-description* | HTTP-TCP-80-0.0.0.0/0-allow HTTP from an....  | HTTP-TCP-80-`sg-ID1`-allow HTTP from an....             |
| *type-protocol-port range-source-description* | HTTP-TCP-443-0.0.0.0/0-allow HTTP from an.... |                                                         |

### Sticky Sessions

#### Session Affinity

- It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer, this works for CLB and ALB.

- The *cookie* used for stickiness has an expiration date you control.

- Pros: Ensure the user doesn't lose his session data. (usecase possibility as well) 

- Cons: Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances.

#### Cookie Names

- **Application-based** cookies.
  
  - It could be:
    
    1. a *custom cookie*, which is,
       
       - Generated by the target,
       
       - Can include any custom attributes required by the application,
       
       - Cookie name must be specified individually for each target group,
       
       - Don't use <span style="color:orange">AWSALB</span>, <span style="color:orange">AWSALBAPP</span> or <span style="color:orange">AWSALBTG</span> (reserved for use by the ELB)
    
    2. an *application cookie*, which is,
       
       - Generated by the load balancer,
       
       - Cookie name is <span style="color:orange">AWSALBAPP</span>.

- **Duration-based** cookies. (or load balancer generated cookie)
  
  - Cookie generated by the load balancer
  
  - Cookie name is <span style="color:orange">AWSALB</span> for ALB, <span style="color:orange">AWSELB</span> for CLB.

### Cross Zone Load Balancing

With <span style='color:limegreen'>**Cross Zone Load Balancing**</span>, each load balancer instance distributes evenly across all  registered instances in all AZ.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aditya109/journey-aws-cloud-architect/main/05-aws-fundamentals-elb-and-asg/assets/elb-cross-zone-balancing.svg)

With <span style='color:blue'>**No Cross Zone Load Balancing**</span>, requests are distributed in the instances of the node of ELB.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aditya109/journey-aws-cloud-architect/main/05-aws-fundamentals-elb-and-asg/assets/elb-no-cross-zone-balancing.svg)

### Cross Zone Load Balancing Feature Availability on Load Balancer

- Application Load Balancer

  - Always on (can't be disabled)
  - No charges for inter AZ data

- Network Load Balancer

  - Disabled by default
  - You pay charges ($) for inter AZ data if enabled

  > You can access these settings by going to the `Attributes` section of the Load Balancer details.

- Classic Load Balancer

  - Disabled by default
  - No charges for inter AZ data if enabled

  > You can access these settings by going to the `Attributes` section of the Load Balancer details.

### SSL Certificates

-  An SSL Certificate allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer to be encrypted in transit (in-flight encryption).
- **SSL** refers to Secure Sockets Layer, used to encrypt connections,
- **TLS** refers to Transport Layer Security, which is a newer version.

> *TLS certificates are mainly used nowadays, yet people still refer as SSL.*

- Public SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authority (CA). E.g., Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy, GlobalSign, Digicert, Letsencrypt, etc.
- SSL certificates have an expiration date (you set) and must be renewed.

### Connection Draining

## CLB (v1)

- Supports TCP (layer 4), HTTP & HTTPS (layer 7)

- Health checks are TCP or HTTP based

- Fixed hostname: `XXX.region.elb.amazonAWS.com`

**Hands-On**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aditya109/journey-aws-cloud-architect/main/05-aws-fundamentals-elb-and-asg/assets/clb-hands-on.svg)

1. Launch an EC2 instance with a application running.

2. Go to `Load Balancers`. 

3. Create a load balancer > Click on `Classic Load Balancer`.

4. Enter details in `Define Load Balancer`.
   
   1. Within `Basic Configuration`, 
      
      - Select `Create an internal load balancer` if you want to make a private lb.
        
        > Next we have protocol:port rules.
        > 
        > | Key                    | Value   |
        > | ---------------------- | ------- |
        > | LB Protocol:Port       | HTTP:80 |
        > | Instance Protocol:Port | HTTP:80 |
   
   2. Assign a Security Group.
   
   3. Configure Security Settings.
   
   4. Configure Health Check. (*health check response timeout < health check interval*)
   
   5. Add EC2 Instances.
   
   6. Add Tags.
   
   7. Click to create.

> The instances moves from <span style="color:orange">OutOfService</span> -> <span style="color:orange">InService</span>.

Open the DNS name from the CLB info section.

> *What could be wrong if say my instances are still* <span style="color:orange">OutOfService</span> ?
> 
> Possibly check security groups if say the HTTP rules are not present in the Inbound rules, the LB would not be able to forward requests to the instances.
> 
> *Ok, but right now I can access my instance directly from outside of the internet as well from the LB, how should I tighten the security?*
> 
> You can change security groups Inbound rules, by delete the existing HTTP rule <span style="color:orange">Source</span>, and then create a new rule with the <span style="color:orange">Source</span> being the CLB security group.

## Application Load Balancer (v2)

- ALB is Layer 7 (HTTP).

- It supports:
  
  - Load balancing to multiple HTTP apps across machines (target groups)
  
  - Load balancing to multiple apps on the same machine (ex. containers)

- It supports:
  
  - For HTTP/2 and Websocket
  
  - Redirects (from HTTP to HTTPS)
  
  - Routing table to different target groups:
    
    - Routing based on path in URL (example.com/users & example.com/posts)
    
    - Routing based on hostname in URL (one.example.com & other.example.com)
    
    - Routing based on Query strings, Headers (example.com/users?id=123&order=false)
  
  - ALB is a great fit for microservices & container-based application (example, Docker, Amazon ECS)
  
  - Supports a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS.

> <span style="color:cyan">Good to know:</span>
> 
> - On creating an ALB, we get a fixed hostname (XXX.region.elb.amazonaws.com).
> - The application servers don't see the IP of the client directly. In order for the EC2 instance to look for client IP, we need to look for the following:
>   - The true IP of the client is inserted in the header **X-Forwarded-For**
>   - We can also get Port (**X-Forwarded-For**) and proto (**X-Forwarded-Proto**)
>

### Target Group Possiblities for ALB

- can be:
  
  - EC2 instances (can be managed by an Auto Scaling Group) - HTTP
  
  - ECS tasks (managed by ECS itself) - HTTP
  
  - Lambda functions - HTTP request is translated into a JSON event.

- Target groups must have IP addresses - must be private IPs.

- ALBs can route to multiple target groups.

- Health checks are at the target group level.

### Query strings/parameters routing

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aditya109/journey-aws-cloud-architect/main/05-aws-fundamentals-elb-and-asg/assets/alb-query-based-routing.svg)

**Hands-On**

1. Launch an EC2 instance with a application running.

2. Go to `Load Balancers`.

3. Create a load balancer > Click on `Application Load Balancer`.

4. Select a `Scheme`.
   
   - A `Scheme` can be `Internet-facing` (routes requests from clients over the internet to targets. Requires a public subnet).
   
   - A `Scheme` can be `Internal` (routes requests from clients to targets using private IP addresses).

5. Select an IP address type.
   
   - IPv4
   
   - Dualstack (IPv4 and IPv6)

6. Select under Network mapping.
   
   1. Select VPC.
   
   2. Select Mappings (we need to select atleast 2 AZs and one subnet per zone, subnets can't be changed after the lb is created.)

7. Select a security group.

8. Specify Listeners and Routing.
   
   - Provide a target group.

9- Create the ALB.

## Network Load Balancer (v2)

- Network load balancers (Layer 4) allow to :
  
  - Forward TCP and UDP traffic to your instances
  
  - Handle millions of requests per seconds
  
  - Less latency ~100ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)

- NLB has one static IP per AZ, supports assigning Elastic IP (helpful in whitelisting specific IP)

- NLB are used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic.

### Target Group Possiblities for NLB

- EC2 Instances

- IP Addresses - must be private IPs

- ALB

**Hands-On**

- Launch an EC2 instance with a application running.

- Go to `Load Balancers`.

- Create a load balancer > Click on `Network Load Balancer`.

- Select a `Scheme`.
  
  - A `Scheme` can be `Internet-facing` (routes requests from clients over the internet to targets. Requires a public subnet).
  
  - A `Scheme` can be `Internal` (routes requests from clients to targets using private IP addresses).

- Select an IP address type.
  
  - IPv4
  
  - Dualstack (IPv4 and IPv6)

- Select under Network mapping.
  
  1. Select VPC.
  
  2. Select Mappings (we need to select atleast 2 AZs and one subnet per zone, subnets can't be changed after the lb is created.)
  
  >  For security group, the sg for instances is itself undertaken by the NLB.

- Specify Listeners and Routing.
  
  - Provide a target group.

- Create the NLB.

> If we directly try to open the URL of NLB, it would be inaccessible, the probable reason would be that the instances are unhealthly. In order to fix that, edit the security groups of the target group, to add in an <span style="color:orange">Inbound Rule</span>, for <span style="color:orange">HTTP</span> type traffic  with <span style="color:orange">TCP</span> Protocol under port <span style="color:orange">80</span>, allowing Source as 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere), which is required for NLB.

## Gateway Load Balancer

- It is used to deploy, scale and manage a fleet of 3<sup>rd</sup> party network virtual appliances in AWS.

- It operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) - IP packets.

- It combines the following functions:
  
  - **Transparent Network Gateway** - single entry/exit for all traffic.
  
  - **Load Balancer** - distributes traffic to your virtual appliances.

- It uses the **GENEVE** protocol on port 6081.

- Example: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems, Deep Packet Inspection Systems, payload manipulation, etc.
