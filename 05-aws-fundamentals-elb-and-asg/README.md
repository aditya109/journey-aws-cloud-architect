# High Availability and Scalability: ELB & ASG

## High Availability and Scalability

Scalability means than an application/system can handle greater loads by adapting.
There are two kinds of scalability:

1. Vertical scalability;

2. Horizontal scalability (=elasticity).

>  *Scalability is linked but linked to high availability.*

High availability means running your application/system in at least 2 data centers (AZ).
The high availability can be:

1. Passive (for RDS Multi AZ for example);

2. Active (for horizontal scaling).

> The goal of high availability is to survive a data center loss.
